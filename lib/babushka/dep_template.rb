  # Standard deps are defined against DepContext, which makes just the basic dep
  # DSL available, i.e. requires/met?/meet, etc. Templated deps are defined against
  # a subclass of TemplatedDepContext as built by +build_context+.
  #
  # This means that when a templated dep is defined, the context will be a superset
  # of that of a standard dep -- the normal stuff, plus whatever the template adds.
